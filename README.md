As part of Microsoft Engage's Facial Recognition track I have made a website which helps a user get a easy medical diagnosis

## Aim

Millions of individuals throughout the world do not have access to or cannot afford basic health care. Furthermore, medical staff have been in exceptionally high demand because to the COVID-19 Pandemic, with not enough to go around for everyone. I propose an AI system that can assist medical staff and potentially substitute them, so that everyone receives the care they deserve while workers can focus on saving lives.

## Tech Stack

The process was both long and arduous but unmistakably fruitful. When I started this project I knew next to nothing about API usage, Node.js and Express.

* Front End: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
* For Face recognition: Face-API that's wrapped with Tensorflow and OpenCV For Speech : Web Speech API
* For Medical Information : Infermedica-API and MediaWiki
* Middleware: Node.js and express

## System Architecture

## Features

* Face Recognition based, User friendly Q/A format website
* Total as well as Health wise percentage based scoring
* Mood Data as well as Emotion based Analysis
* Articles to spread awarness and engage user
